# American-Sign-Language-Detection 
This is example of detecting letter F through binary classification. Any letter can be predicted using the dataset. CNN model is used to perform the prediction. At the end we get almost completely correct prediction. Callback technique Early Stopping is being used here to increase the accuracy. You find complete code, its implementation and output above in file asl_project.ipynb
